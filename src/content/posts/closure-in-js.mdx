## Introduction

Recently I started to read the book Eloquent JavaScript where I came across this concept called closure. And I have to say I was really impressed with this feature in JavaScript.

In this article we will learn about the concept of Closure in JavaScript with few examples. We will do a code walkthrough as well.

Maybe you will learn few things about functions as well.

In the end I hope you will have clear mental model about Closures in JavaScript.
Let's get started.

## Important points about functions in JS

Before taking dive into closure, I want you to understand two things about functions in JavaScript.

**The first point I want you to remember is that functions re-creates its local variables every time it is called.**

See the following example,

```js showLineNumbers {6-7}
function handleTrophies() {
  let trophies = 0;
  trophies += 1;
  console.log(trophies);
}
handleTrophies(); // --> 1
handleTrophies(); // --> 1
```

The function _handleTrophies_ re-creates value of trophies variable every time it is called. That is why however many times we call the _handleTrophies_ functions the same value will be console logged. It will never be more than one.

Let's move on to the second point.

**The second point is, in JavaScript, functions are not only syntax but value as well. They can be assigned to variables.**

```js showLineNumbers {6}
function outer() {
  function inner() {}
  return inner;
}
const fncall = outer();
console.log(fncall); // ƒ inner () {}
```

We can see that _fncallholds_ the value which is a function.

If we will write it as _fncall()_, it will work as a function.

## Notion of Closure

These two points above brings an interesting question, what happens to the local values when the function that created them is no longer active?

```js
function outer() {
  let temp = 10;
  function inner() {
    return temp;
  }
  return inner;
}
const fncall = outer();
console.dir(fncall);
```

In the above example, _fncall_ holds function called _inner_ as a value which is returned by a function called *outer* . The function _outer_ is now no longer active.

The output of above code snippet is as follows.

<div>
  <Image
    className="rounded-md my-4 mx-auto"
    src="/closure-blog-1.png"
    width={500}
    height={500}
    alt="closure-blog-1"
  />
</div>

We can see that closure has preserved value of **temp**.

This feature of being able to reference a specific instance of local variable in an enclosing scope is called as closure.

It simply means that inner function can access the variable of outer function's variable with help of closure.

So the main feature of closure would be it allows to remember values from completely different scope. To say it in more fancy way, Closure keeps values alive.

Lets look at another example to understand closure better.

```js
function updateLike() {
  let like = 5;
  function handleLike() {
    like += 1;
    return like;
  }
  return handleLike;
}
let call_one = updateLike();
let call_two = updateLike();
console.log(call_one()); // 6 --- point 1
console.log(call_two()); // 6 --- point 2
console.log(call_one()); // 7 --- point 3
console.log(call_two()); // 7 --- point 4
```

Code walkthrough:

1. _call_one_ has the _handleLike_ function body as its value.

2. _call_two_ as well has _handleLike_ function body as its value.

3. But both these values stored in _call_one_ and _call_two_ are not same. Because, the function calls made to _updateLike_ were made separately and it returned a brand new _handleLike_ function as a value each time.

4. When we execute *call_one()* , we are executing the function which _call_one_ has in its value. At point 1, before executing the statement, the value of like stored in closure of _call_one_ is 5.

5. While executing the statement at point 1, the value of like is incremented to 6 from 5 and stored in the scope of _call_one_ as closure.

6. Similarly it will update to 7 at point 3.

7. Now at point 2, before executing the statement the value of like in closure of _call_two_ is 5 and not 6. And then it will be updated to 6.

8. Similarly it will be updated to 7 at point 4.

I hope this example give you a good mental model.

## Points to remember about Closure.

1. Closure is property of JavaScript function alone.

2. When called the function body(in our example _handleLike_) sees the environment in which it was created and not in the environment it is called.

3. The inner function(in our example _handleLike_ or inner) has access to inner variables, the outer function variables and global variables.

4. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

This is it from my side on Closure in JavaScript. I hope I am leaving you with good understanding of this topic.
